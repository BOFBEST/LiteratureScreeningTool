# LiteratureScreeningTool 

## Goal 

The Literature Screening Tool (LST) is a set of tools that can be helpful to screen academic literature for literature studies in a systematic and reproducible way.

## Branches 

The tool consists of 3 branches:  

- the first branch ("Retrieval") retrieves all the articles 

- the second branch ("Screening Tool") screens the articles in a flask app. 

- the last branch ("Analysis") analyses the output from the screening process and outputs the results as pkl files or xlsx tables 

## Settings 

To retrieve the articles, you'll need specific API codes. These are not provided and can be required by contacting the corresponding customer services. 

An empty settings file will be provided where "###" needs to substituted with the corresponding values.
